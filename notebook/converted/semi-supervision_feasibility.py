# # Semi-supervision Feasibility
# This notebook evaluates the data to see how much unlabeled blood data exists in the refine.bio human compendium. If enough exists, it will be important to evaluate whether semi-supervision helps model performance

# ## Conclusion
# There is a large number of blood samples that don't have labels. These samples can be used for semi-supervised learning, and the number of unlabeled samples is large enough to make it worth trying.
